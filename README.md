# automated-pricing-scraper :money_with_wings::money_with_wings:

This project was completed on behalf of a company that needed to update pricing of some products using a supplier's website. The solution I came up with was to automate the task of manually searching for product codes and typing recommended pricing into a spreadsheet. In order to acheive this I decided to use Python to create a web scraper that would log into the supplier website and search automatically for product codes given by the spreadsheet. Upon finding the product page, the RRP would be "scraped" and updated in the correct column.

The aim of this project was to complete my first project for a professional business and learn more about web development in the process through analysis of how requests are made to web servers through the Python [mechanize](https://pypi.org/project/mechanize/) library.
